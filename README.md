# hello-world
First ad foremost I am not good at this stuff. I want to be and it looks like a great place learn some new skills. The primary focus is to improve my personal security and stay up to date with the latest and great in cyber security .
I don't know if it is a bad thing to say on here but I have been using a macbook pro that could use some touching up. I have through the years checked and unchecked things that I probably shouldn't have. It runs but as said before it is an older model. I will upgrade in the year to come. I also want to emphasize that I am not or have ever been techy at all and it is probably why I have Macbook Pro.
